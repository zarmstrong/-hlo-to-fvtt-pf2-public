### TODO (in order of priority, sort of):
 - ~~spell support~~
 - import gear/items - basic support complete, this is always being worked on as more issues crop up.
 - more PFS support (waiting on more features from HLO)
 - maybe figure out some modifiers that aren't in the HLO output, like perception, key ability, etc
 - change diety icon
